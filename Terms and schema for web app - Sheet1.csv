Ligand,"A ligand is a molecule that binds specifically to a larger molecule, typically a protein, often to form a complex and elicit a biological response. Ligands can include ions, small organic molecules, or larger macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids."
Receptor,"A receptor is a protein molecule that receives and responds to a specific ligand, such as a hormone, neurotransmitter, or other signaling molecule, triggering a cellular response."
Second messenger,"A second messenger is a small intracellular molecule that relays and amplifies signals within the cell, often originating from an activated receptor or another protein further down in the signaling pathway, to elicit a specific cellular response."
